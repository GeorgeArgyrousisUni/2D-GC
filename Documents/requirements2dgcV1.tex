\section{Introduction}

2-dimensional Gas Chromatography (2D-GC) is a chemical technique to accurately identify and quantify small traces of compounds in samples. This analytical technique is used in Groningen to aid in the search for new biofuels. For this research, accurate and interactive software for 3D-visualization and analysis is necessary. 

We aim to build a desktop app to visualise 2D-GC data, and try to work in comparative analysis, where the same analysis can be run smoothly on multiple samples.

% might need to (partially) be converted to user stories
\subsection*{Critical Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Show 2D-GC output .txt files as 3-dimensional graphs
	\item Show 2D-GC output .txt files as 2-dimensional graphs
    \item Integrate the matrix values between input x and y values, and label these peaks
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Important Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Be able to save the image with any attached user inputs such as integration or labels
	\item Input of extra integration parameters besides x and y (the client named only one example, we may need to ask what other parameters they need or want)
	\item Zooming, rotation, changing color of the visualization
	\item Peak selection (a basic way of implementation could be to have the user draw circles around a peak in a 2D visualization, and retrieve x and y from this)
    \item Be able to save peak data in a database, with any attached information, such as which sample it was from, integration value, labels etc.. The user should be able to retrieve previously saved information in a look-up table while looking at a new sample.
	\item Automatic peak finding
	\item Show 2D-GC output .txt files as 1-dimensional graphs (integrated data)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Useful Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pipelining for comparisons between samples
	\item Compound recognition/matching
	\item Signal to noise ratio convolution
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Won't Do}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Linking to an outside Mass-Spectrometry (MS) library. This is something which would be useful, as the client may switch from an FID detector to an MS detector in the near future. However, this would add a layer of complexity, as MS data adds an extra dimension to the data. We think it best to focus on a stable program for FID visualization, as this can also be used for GCxGC-MS data. 
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Non-functional requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Extensibility:} this is essential, as the client is preparing to switch to a different detection system, which alters the dimensionality of the data. We have to make sure that this extension would be easily incorporated in the program. 
	\item \textbf{Technology:} the program needs to run on older versions of operating systems, as the measurement software is run on windows XP. 
\end{itemize}


\section{User Stories}
\begin{itemize}
	\item As a chemical analyst, I want to find the quantity of a specific compound in multiple samples, and compare these quantities. 
	\item As a chemical analyst, I want to quickly view the outcome of a diagnostic test by visually assaying the 3D graph. 
	\item As a chemical analyst publishing research, I want to have a way to show the data in a visually appealing manner, so that a saved image would be appropriate for publication. 
	\item As a chemical analyst, I want to be able to be able to find the quantity of a larger chemical group in my sample by freeform selection of groups of peaks. 
	\item As a developer, I want to be able to extend the program to work with GCxGC-MS, where an extra identification dimension is added on top of the 2D-GC data. 
\end{itemize}
