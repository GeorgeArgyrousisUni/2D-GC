# 2D-GC

Please make a folder called `Documents` in this branch. Inside your document folder you will add your requirements and/or architecture document with the following format: `<name of the document><project name><version>`. 

You will be using camelCase to seperate the words in between. For example if you want to submit your requirements document for iteration 1 your document name will be `requirements2dgcV1`.

@NOTE Make sure to add both the `.pdf` and the `.tex` file for each document that you will be submitting.
